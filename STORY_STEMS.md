# Story Stems (Optional Inspiration)

These stems are **non-prescriptive**.
They exist to signal tone, scope, and acceptable levels of ambition.

You are not required to use them.
Original concepts are strongly encouraged.

- *A wizard maps the flow of magic and discovers it propagates through fungal networks older than language itself. If spells are metabolites rather than incantations, who — or what — has been cultivating them?*

- *A chronomancer engineers his own grandfather paradox, only to uncover an infinite regress of ancestors doing the same. At what point does causality become a family tradition rather than a law?*

- *Runes decay not by fading, but by remembering previous meanings. Each act of reading collapses the symbol differently. No two wizards ever see the same rune. What happens when symbols accumulate semantic debt?*

- *A god is found drowned in a well that predates divinity. If gods arrived late, what was worshipped before belief learned their names?*

- *A wizard proves that wonder is a finite, measurable resource. When supplies begin to run low, who decides which civilizations are allowed to feel awe?*

If you submit a story inspired by one of these stems, you are free to diverge entirely. These are starting points, not constraints.
