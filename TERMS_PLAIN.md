# Plain-Language Contributor Terms

Before you submit a story, read this first.

These points explain what you are agreeing to when you send us a story. It’s the same content as the formal terms, but written clearly.

## What you are giving us
- You still own your story.
- But you allow us to publish, edit, and sell it as part of this book.
- We may edit your story for quality and consistency.

## Editing
- We will make edits for clarity and cohesion.
- You do not have to approve every edit.
- You agree to this when you submit.

## AI use
- If you used AI in any part of your story, you must tell us.
- Not telling us can get your story rejected.

## Money (if any)
- If the book makes money, we share it as described in the revenue section of the project.
- Payments will be in regular intervals.
- The project may never make money — that’s normal.

## Your role
- You are not a partner, employee, or co-owner of this project.
- You are a contributor.

## Original work
- You promise the story is your own, and it does not break laws or use someone else’s content without permission.

## Platform stuff
- We aim to publish on Amazon KDP.
- Amazon may accept, reject, or remove the book.
- That is not the project’s fault.

## Tokens and money
- Naming a token in your story is for fun and narrative only.
- It does not mean revenue will be paid to a token holder.

## Withdrawing your story
- You can take your story back **before** we lock the book for publication.
- After lock date, stories cannot be taken back.

## Summary
By submitting, you agree to these points.
If you do not agree, do not submit.
