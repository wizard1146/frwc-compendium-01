# Forgotten Runes Community Short Story Compendium

## Purpose

Demonstrate that **the community** can responsibly deliver a monetisable creative product under real constraints.

This project prioritises execution over perfection. The objective is a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** that proves coordination, quality control, follow-through, and fair handling of revenue (if any).

---

## SMART Objective

 - **Specific**: Compile **10 short stories** written by FRWC community members, each centred around a single FRWC token from the ecosystem, set within the Runiverse, and to be published as a unified short-story compendium

 - **Measurable**: 
	 - 10 accepted stories
	 - Each story 6,000 to 10,000 words
	 - Final manuscript target 60,000 words
	 - Book published and listed for sale on Distribution Platform

 - **Attainable**: Scope is intentionally limited: short fiction only, constrained timeline, single editor with veto authority, predefined kill criteria.

 - **Relevant**: Establish proof-of-community capability: creative output, governance, delivery under time pressure and equitable revenue handling (if any).

 - **Time-based**: 
	 - Submissions open immediately
	 - Initial submission window: 30 days
	 - Extension window: +30 days (see Kill Criteria)
	 - End-to-end completion target: 14th April 2026

## Revenue Sharing

If the compendium generates revenue, it will be distributed transparently according to the structure below.

### Allocation Overview

From **Net Receipts** (after platform fees, taxes, refunds, and processing costs):

* **Marketing — 6%**
  Reserved for marketing and promotion.
  Marketing spend is capped at **USD 8,000** in total; any unused surplus is redistributed equally to story contributors.

* **Project Support — 2%**
  Retained by the project lead for cost recovery and potential follow-up work.
  If no second iteration occurs within 1 year, this amount will be passed in full to the **House of Wizards DAO**.

* **Title Contest — 1%**
  Awarded to the selected compendium title.

* **Cover Art Contest — 1%**
  Awarded to the selected cover artwork.

* **Contributors — Remainder**
  Distributed equally among all accepted story contributors
  (e.g. with 10 stories, approximately 8–9% per contributor, depending on threshold allocations).

### Threshold Allocations

If total sales exceed **USD 5,000**:

* **Judges — 2.5%**
  Allocated as a thank-you for review and evaluation work.

* **Magic Machine — 7.5%**
  Allocated as a contribution to project infrastructure and support.

All allocations are capped so that total distribution does not exceed 100%.
