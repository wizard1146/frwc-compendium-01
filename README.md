## Purpose ##

Demonstrate that **the community** can responsibly deliver a monetisable creative product under real constraints.

This project prioritises execution over perfection. The objective is a Minimum Viable Product that proves coordination, quality control, and follow-through.

### SMART Objective ###

- **Specific**: Compile **10 short stories** written by FRWC community members, each centred around a single FRWC token from the ecosystem, set within the Runiverse, and to be published as a unified short-story compendium

 - **Measurable**: 
	 - 10 accepted stories
	 - Each story 6,000 to 10,000 words
	 - Final manuscript target 60,000 words
	 - Book published and listed for sale on Distribution Platform

 - **Attainable**: Scope is intentionally limited: short fiction only, constrained timeline, single editor with veto authority, predefined kill criteria.

 - **Relevant**: Establish proof-of-community capability: creative output, governance, delivery under time pressure and equitable revenue handling (if any).

 - **Time-based**: 
	 - Submissions open immediately
	 - Initial submission window: 30 days
	 - Extension window: +30 days (see Kill Criteria)
	 - End-to-end completion target: 14th April 2026

### Scope ###
- Target contributors: 10
- Token requirement: One central FRWC token per story
- Additional tokens: will not be included in revenue sharing conceptually; please clear permissions with token owner if not author.
- Exclusions:
	- Poetry
	- Serialised fiction
	- Lore encyclopaedia entries
	- Fanfiction outside the Runiverse

---
## Revenue Sharing ##
- Assuming any revenue is generated:
	- 6% - retained for marketing; hard upper cap on marketing of 15,000 USD; any surplus gets distributed equally to story contributors
	- 2% - retained by project lead for cost recovery and potential second iteration;
		- if no second iteration occurs (see Follow Through for timeline), this sum in entirety will be passed through to the House of Wizards DAO
	- 1% - Title Contest winner
	- 1% - Cover Art Contest winner
	- Remainder revenue - distributed equally to all story contributors; e.g. 10 stories, 8 - 9% each (see below)
	- Above 5,000 USD in total sales: 5% retained for thanks to Judges
	- Above 5,000 USD in total sales: 10% - Magic Machine
- Frequency:
	- Fortnightly reporting
	- Monthly revenue

**Token linkage (aspirational, non-enforceable):**  
Each story nominates one central FRWC token. The owner of that token is the intended representative revenue bearer.

## Sectionals ##

### Submission Requirements ###

#### Context ####
 - set in the Runiverse
 - feature a main FRWC token
#### Framing ####
 - although not necessary, consider incorporating canon events inside the lived Runiverse - *The Burning*, *The Opening of the Seventh Gate*, *The Arrival of the Warriors*

#### Narrative Aim ####
Not lore exposition. 
Stories should evoke **a sense of wonder, discovery and tension** about the unexplored universe of FRWC.
#### Length ####
 - at a target of 60,000 words for the compendium, and 10 stories for the compendium,
 - each story submission must lie between 6,000 to 10,000 words maximum
#### Inspiration (Non-prescriptive) ####
 - consider inspiration from the following and other compendiums:
		 - **Stories of Your Life and Others: Ted Chiang**. [link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223380.Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others)
		 - **Ambiguity Machines and Other stories: Vandana Singh**. [link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34381090-ambiguity-machines-and-other-stories)
		 - **The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories: Ken Liu**. [link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24885533-the-paper-menagerie-and-other-stories)

#### Style Cohesion / Substantive Rewrite ####
- submission implies agreement to **substantive editorial rewrites** for tone, pacing, and cohesion across the compendium.

### Compendium Title ###
 - a contest will be held for the appropriate naming once 7 stories are collected; see Revenue

### Compendium Cover Art ###
- a contest will be held for the appropriate cover art once 7 stories are collected; see Revenue

---
## Extension Period ##

If we receive at least 2 stories inside the first 30 days, we will extend story collection for another 30 days. Total 60 days will be the *hard limit* for story collection (see Kill Criteria).

---
## Kill Criteria for Project ##

1. Receive less than 2 stories inside first 30 days.
2. Receive less than 7 stories inside extended period.
3. Reject first 4 stories received (*pressure for quality producers to avoid perfection trap*)

### Editorial Rubric ###

#### 1. Core Eligibility (Hard Gates)

Failure on any item → **automatic rejection**.

- Set recognisably in the **Runiverse**
- One clearly identifiable **primary FRWC token**
- Word count **6,000–10,000**
- Complete narrative (not an excerpt, vignette, or outline)
- Author agrees to **substantive editorial rewrite**
- No plagiarism or undisclosed AI-generated text

#### 2. Narrative Quality (40%)

Evaluates whether the story stands on its own as fiction.

**Scored 0–10 per subdomain**

- **Narrative coherence**  
    Clear causal structure. Events progress intelligibly. No reliance on external lore to make sense.
- **Tension & stakes**  
    Meaningful uncertainty. Something is risked, altered, or revealed.
- **Resolution integrity**  
    Ending is deliberate. Ambiguity allowed; incoherence not.

> Editorial bias: prefer _clean execution_ over experimental ambition.

#### 3. World Integration (25%)

Assesses how effectively the story inhabits the Runiverse.

- **Token centrality**  
    The nominated FRWC token materially affects plot or theme. No cosmetic inclusion.
- **Canon adjacency**  
    Respects established tone and metaphysics. Canon events may be referenced but not contradicted unless explicitly justified.
- **Runiverse texture**  
    Setting feels lived-in. Avoids lore-dumps and glossary-style exposition.

#### 4. Conceptual Signal (20%)

Measures intellectual or thematic weight.

- **Core idea density**  
    At least one strong speculative idea drives the story.
- **Originality within constraints**  
    Familiar tropes acceptable if recombined or reframed.
- **Aftertaste**  
    Story leaves a lingering question, image, or conceptual disturbance.

#### 5. Style & Editability (15%)

Not about polish; about **edit leverage**.

- **Prose clarity**  
    Sentences parse cleanly. Meaning recoverable even if style is uneven.
- **Voice malleability**  
    Willingness and capacity for stylistic alignment across the compendium.
- **Structural fixability**  
    Problems appear solvable by revision rather than total rewrite.

---

## Scoring & Decisions

- **Accept (Immediate)**  
    Strong across categories; revision expected but limited.
- **Conditional Accept**  
    Core idea strong; requires targeted structural or thematic rewrite.
- **Reject**  
    Fails eligibility gates or would require a full reconceptualisation.

Numerical scores guide discussion but **do not bind final decisions**.

## Sample Stems ##

 - *A wizard maps the flow of magic and realizes it propagates through fungal networks older than language itself; if spells are metabolites rather than incantations, who or what has been cultivating them?*

- *A chronomancer engineers his own grandfather paradox, only to discover an infinite regress of ancestors doing the same - at what point does causality become a family tradition rather than a law?*

- *The runes begin to decay, not by fading but by remembering previous meanings; what happens to reality when symbols accumulate semantic debt? A wizard notes that the act of reading the rune collapses it - no two wizards ever see the same rune. What does this mean?*

- *A god is found drowned in a well that predates divinity; if gods can be latecomers, what was worshipped before belief learned their names?*

- *A wizard proves that wonder is a finite resource in the universe, measurable and exhaustible - who decides which civilizations are allowed to feel awe when supplies run low?*
